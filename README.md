# Evaluation criteria

    // NOTE All of this bias toward existing technology, the upperbound might not be future proof.
    // TODO we gonna need some kind of ratio or coefficiant here later
Score range from 1 to 5, anything less than 1 is not permit, to create a centerline at 3.

Scalability analysis using relative comparison with prior data.
Scalability is define as an ability to increasingly support more node, load, feature, Storage, bandwidth without exponential incuring cost, latency and no significant degredation in performance
Scalability score at 1 if number of node have a comparably scalability to Bitcoin in 2020
Scalability score at 3 if number of node in the chain scale linearly with cost
Scalability score at 5 if the chain scale like BFT permissioned node

QUESTION can we make this a percentage
Security in term of compromise for scalability and/or decentralization not relate to software quality.
Security score at 5 if chain require more that 1/2 dishonest node to compromise both consistency and liveness of the network
Security score at 4 if chain require more that 1/2 dishonest node to compromise consistency or liveness of the network
Security score at 3 if chain require 1/3 dishonest node to compromise liveness of the network
Security score at 2 if chain require 1/3 dishonest node to compromise consistency of the network
Security score at 1 if chain require 1/3 dishonest node to compromise both consistency and liveness of the network

Network Concensus Provider (NCP) is a network participant that influence concensus of the network
Decentralize score at 1 if 100% NCP interest aligned
Decentralize score at 3 if 50% of NCP interest aligned
Decentralize score at 5 if 0% NCP interest aligned
